## Executive Summary

This project addresses the critical challenge of declining maize yields in Kenya due to climate change. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts maize yields based on climate variables and other relevant factors. This model will empower Kenyan farmers, policymakers, and researchers with data-driven insights to make informed decisions about crop management, resource allocation, and adaptation strategies, ensuring food security and economic stability in the face of a changing climate.

## Problem Statement

Maize, the staple food crop in Kenya, faces significant threats from climate change. Shifting weather patterns, including unpredictable rainfall, increased temperatures, and extreme weather events, disrupt traditional planting seasons and negatively impact crop yields. This poses a severe risk to food security, economic stability, and the livelihoods of millions of Kenyan farmers who depend on maize production.

## Project Objectives

- **Develop a robust machine learning model:** Predict maize yields in Kenya with high accuracy based on historical and real-time climate data, soil data, and other relevant agricultural factors.
- **Identify key climate variables:** Quantify the impact of specific climate factors on maize yields to enable targeted adaptation strategies.
- **Empower stakeholders with actionable insights:** Deliver user-friendly tools and resources based on model predictions to assist farmers, policymakers, and researchers in making informed decisions related to planting schedules, crop management, and resource allocation.

## Project Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing (Month 1)

- Gather historical climate data (temperature, rainfall, humidity) from meteorological departments and publicly available datasets.
- Obtain maize yield data from the Ministry of Agriculture, agricultural research institutions, and other relevant sources.
- Collect soil data, pest and disease incidence data, and information on agricultural practices.
- Clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering and Model Development (Month 2)

- Engineer new features from raw data to extract meaningful insights and improve model accuracy.
- Explore various machine learning algorithms (linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines) and select the best-performing model based on rigorous evaluation metrics.
- Train and validate the model using historical data, optimizing hyperparameters to maximize predictive accuracy.

### Phase 3: Model Evaluation, Deployment, and Dissemination (Month 3)

- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (R-squared, RMSE, MAE) and visualize results to communicate insights effectively.
- Develop a user-friendly interface (web application or mobile app) to make model predictions accessible to target stakeholders.
- Conduct workshops and training sessions to educate farmers, extension workers, and policymakers on using the tool and interpreting its outputs.

## Project Deliverables

- **Functional machine learning model:** Capable of accurately predicting maize yields based on input variables.
- **User-friendly interface:** Providing easy access to model predictions and insights for farmers, policymakers, and researchers.
- **Comprehensive project report:** Documenting the methodology, data sources, model development, and evaluation results.
- **Training materials and workshops:** Equipping stakeholders with the knowledge and skills to utilize the model effectively.
